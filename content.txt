1. class and object (example)
2. class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called object oriented programming language - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantage of OOPS
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability 
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
