1. class and object (example)
2. class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called object oriented programming language - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantage of OOPS
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability 
    > debugging
    > easy to colab 
    
5. End to End project (chatbook class)

    > function vs method
    > magic method vs dunder method
    > self
    > you can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > debugging
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why inheritance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > what gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > super keyword(can be used only when inside a class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside a child class)

    > Types of Inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchichal | 4. Multiple <Diamond problem> | 5. Hybrid
